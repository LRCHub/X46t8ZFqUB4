[00:07.97] I want you to know that it's our time
[00:12.22] You and me bleed the same light
[00:15.49] I want you to know that I'm all yours
[00:19.54] You and me run the same course
[00:34.54] 
[00:22.82] I'm slippin' down a chain reaction
[00:26.57] And here I go, here I go, here I go, go
[00:30.22] And once again, I'm yours in fractions
[00:33.93] It takes me down, pulls me down, pulls me down low
[00:58.93] 
[00:37.95] Honey, it's rainin' tonight
[00:41.33] But storms always have an eye, have an eye
[00:45.20] Tell me you're covered tonight
[00:48.70] Or tell me lies, tell me lies, lies
[01:06.20] 
[00:54.29] I want you to know that it's our time
[00:58.37] You and me bleed the same light
[01:01.66] I want you to know that I'm all yours
[01:05.74] You and me, we're the same force
[01:21.74] 
[01:09.04] I want you to know that it's our time
[01:13.24] You and me bleed the same light
[01:16.33] I want you to know that I'm all yours
[01:20.57] You and me run the same course
[01:35.57] 
[01:53.38] I want you to know that it's our time
[01:57.30] You and me bleed the same light
[02:12.80] 
[02:00.84] I'm better under your reflection
[02:04.30] But did you know, did you know, did you know, know?
[02:08.18] That's anybody else that's met ya
[02:11.87] It's all the same, all the same, all the same glow
[02:36.87] 
[02:15.78] Honey, it's raining tonight
[02:19.17] But storms always have an eye, have an eye
[02:23.03] Tell me you're covered tonight
[02:26.50] Or tell me lies, tell me lies, lies
[02:44.00] 
[02:30.23] I want you to know that it's our time
[02:34.31] You and me bleed the same light
[02:37.53] I want you to know that I'm all yours
[02:41.73] You and me, we're the same force
[02:57.73] 
[02:44.95] I want you to know that it's our time
[02:49.05] You and me bleed the same light
[02:52.32] I want you to know that I'm all yours
[02:56.47] You and me run the same course
[03:11.47] 
[03:11.38] You and me run the same course
[03:26.38] 
[03:44.16] I want you to know that it's our time
[03:48.20] You and me bleed the same light
[03:51.48] I want you to know that I'm all yours
[03:55.55] You and me run the same course
